Here are some **Java Collections interview questions** ranging from basic to advanced levels, covering **List, Set, Map, Queue, and performance considerations**:  

### **Basic-Level Questions**  
1. **What is the Java Collections Framework?**  
2. **Differentiate between `List`, `Set`, and `Map`.**  
3. **What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`? When would you use each?**  
4. **Why doesn’t `Map` extend the `Collection` interface?**  
5. **What is the difference between `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, and `TreeSet`?**  
6. **How does `HashMap` work internally in Java?**  
7. **What is the default capacity of `ArrayList` in Java?**  
8. **What happens when you add a duplicate element to a `HashSet`?**  
9. **Why should keys in `HashMap` be immutable?**  
10. **What is the difference between `Comparable` and `Comparator`?**  

### **Intermediate-Level Questions**  
11. **How does `ConcurrentHashMap` achieve thread-safety?**  
12. **What is the difference between `fail-fast` and `fail-safe` iterators?**  
13. **Why does `HashMap` allow one `null` key but `Hashtable` does not?**  
14. **How does `TreeMap` maintain sorting order?**  
15. **What is the difference between `PriorityQueue` and `LinkedList`?**  
16. **How do you synchronize an `ArrayList` in Java?**  
17. **What is the contract between `equals()` and `hashCode()`?**  
18. **What is the difference between `Collections.synchronizedList()` and `CopyOnWriteArrayList`?**  
19. **Why is `Vector` considered legacy in Java?**  
20. **How does `LinkedHashMap` maintain insertion order?**  

### **Advanced-Level Questions**  
21. **What is the time complexity of `contains()` in `ArrayList` vs. `HashSet`?**  
22. **How does Java handle hash collisions in `HashMap`?**  
23. **What is the significance of the `load factor` in `HashMap`?**  
24. **How does `TreeSet` ensure uniqueness and sorting?**  
25. **What are the differences between `BlockingQueue`, `ArrayDeque`, and `PriorityQueue`?**  
26. **How would you implement a custom `HashMap` in Java?**  
27. **What are the performance implications of using `LinkedList` vs. `ArrayList` for frequent insertions/deletions?**  
28. **How does Java’s `WeakHashMap` work, and when would you use it?**  
29. **What is the difference between `IdentityHashMap` and `HashMap`?**  
30. **How would you design an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using `LinkedHashMap`?**  

### **Coding-Based Questions**  
31. **Write a program to sort a `HashMap` by values.**  
32. **How would you remove duplicates from an `ArrayList` without using `HashSet`?**  
33. **Implement a `Stack` using `LinkedList`.**  
34. **Find the first non-repeated character in a string using `LinkedHashMap`.**  
35. **Merge two sorted `ArrayLists` into a single sorted list.**  

Would you like detailed answers to any of these questions? Or do you need more questions on a specific topic (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`, `Comparator` sorting, etc.)?
